# Simon Says

## Description 

Display 5 random numbers on the page. From there a 30 second timer starts.

After 30 seconds the numbers disappear and the user must enter, one at a time, the numbers he saw previously, using the prompt().

After the 5 numbers have been entered, the software says how many and which of the numbers to guess have been identified.
